These projects and notes are from a Javascript course I took on the web.  
## Topics include:
- JavaScript and programming fundamentals: variables, boolean logic, if/else, loops, functions, arrays, etc.
- Complex features like the 'this' keyword, function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures
- Asynchronous JavaScript: The event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX and APIs
- Modern JavaScript for 2018: NPM, Webpack, Babel and ES6 modules
- A true understanding of how JavaScript works behind the scenes
- What's new in ES6: arrow functions, classes, default and rest parameters, etc.
- Practice your new skills with coding challenges (solutions included)
- Organize and structure your code using JavaScript patterns like modules  
  
### Project 1 - DOM Pig Game  
Created the pig game on the DOM using vanilla JS. Learned how to use basic JS syntax, arrays, objects, loops, and DOM Manipulation using ES5.  
  

### Project 2 - Budgety  
Broke down a complex budget calculator app into 3 different modules for proper organization and readability using ES5:
- App Controller
- UI Controller
- Budget Controller  
The App Controller was used to communicate the data between the Budget Controller and UI Controller to calculate and display budgets.  
  
### Project 3 - Forkify  
Created a website that reads recipes from an API and returns back the information, properly formatted, to the user on the DOM using advanced features of JS and ES6 - ES8.  
This project utilized:  
- NodeJS
- Webpack
- Babel
- Polyfilling
- Modules
