Complex features like the 'this' keyword, function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures
Asynchronous JavaScript: The event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX and APIs
Modern JavaScript for 2018: NPM, Webpack, Babel and ES6 modules
A true understanding of how JavaScript works behind the scenes
What's new in ES6: arrow functions, classes, default and rest parameters, etc.
Practice your new skills with coding challenges (solutions included)
Organize and structure your code using JavaScript patterns like modules
Get friendly and fast support in the course Q&A
Downloadable lectures, code and design assets for all projects
